To load the website, you can use the website link above.

The home page has two buttons, one is the "Note Taker" text on the top left to bring back to the current home page, the other is the "Get Started" button to start the application.

The note page still has the home button on the top left, but also has a edit and save icon on the right side. The save button only shows when there is text filed in. To make a note, fill information into the "Note Title" and "Note Text" boxes and click save, this will create a box on the left side of your note. To deleate the note, click the trash button on the right side of each note.
